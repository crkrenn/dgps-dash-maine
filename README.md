To help Maine voters make their final decisions for the Maine Senate and House of Representatives elections next week, a new website (https://dash.democracygps.org) allows visitors to easily explore and compare the voting histories of Maine politicians. For example, visitors can compare the voting histories of Nicole Grohoski and Brian Langley, who are both running for the Maine Senate District 7 seat. Grohoski has voted mostly (94% of the time) with her fellow Democrats, but Langley’s voting record is more liberal than many other Maine Republicans, having voted with the Democratic majority 50% of the time.

The website provides a view of all recent Senate and House members that shows how often each politician voted with the Democratic or Republican majorities and a measure of how polarized their voting records were (negative for more agreement with the Democrats and positive for more agreement with the Republicans).

* See Grohoski_Langley_Figure

The website also lists some of the most independent or bipartisan votes for each politician, allows visitors to easily search the complete voting histories of current and recent Maine state senators and representatives since 2017, and shows which bills were most polarizing. The website was produced by democracyGPS, a not-for-profit electronic democracy company based near Oakland, California. Chris Krenn, the founder of democracyGPS, believes that “Voting histories should be more important that 30 second advertising sound bites.”
